  "readme": "# Responsive\n\nResponsive will automatically optimise the table's layout for different screen sizes through the dynamic column visibility control, making your tables useful on desktop and mobile screens.\n\n\n# Installation\n\nTo use Responsive the best way to obtain the software is to use the [DataTables downloader](//datatables.net/download). You can also include the individual files from the [DataTables CDN](//cdn.datatables.net). See the [documentation](http://datatables.net/extensions/responsive/) for full details.\n\n\n# Basic usage\n\nResponsive is initialised using the `responsive` option in the DataTables constructor - a simple boolean `true` will enable the feature. Further options can be specified using this option as an object - see the documentation for details.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n$(document).ready( function () {\n    $('#myTable').DataTable( {\n    \tresponsive: true\n    } );\n} );\n```\n\n\n# Documentation / support\n\n* [Documentation](https://datatables.net/extensions/responsive/)\n* [DataTables support forums](http://datatables.net/forums)\n\n\n# GitHub\n\nIf you fancy getting involved with the development of Responsive and help make it better, please refer to its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DataTables/Responsive).\n\n",
