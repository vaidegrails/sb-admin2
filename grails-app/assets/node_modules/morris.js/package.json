I keep an eye\non the issues, but I rarely have the time to fix bugs or review pull requests.\n\nIf you're interested in actively contributing to Morris.js, please contact me on\nthe email address above.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (>= 1.7 recommended, but it'll probably work with\n  older versions)\n- [Raphael.js](http://raphaeljs.com/) (>= 2.0)\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [the website](http://morrisjs.github.com/morris.js/).\n\n## Development\n\nVery daring.\n\nFork, hack, possibly even add some tests, then send a pull request :)\n\nRemember that Morris.js is a coffeescript project. Please make your changes in\nthe `.coffee` files, not in the compiled javascript files in the root directory\nof the project.\n\n### Developer quick-start\n\nYou'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org).  I recommend using\n[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for installing node in\ndevelopment environments.\n\nWith node installed, install [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) using\n`npm install -g grunt-cli`, and then the rest of the test/build dependencies\nwith `npm install` in the morris.js project folder.\n\nOnce you're all set up, you can compile, minify and run the tests using `grunt`.\n\nNote: I'm experimenting with using perceptual diffs to catch rendering\nregressions. Due to font rendering differences between platforms, the pdiff\ntests currently *only* pass on OS X.\n\n## Changelog\n\n### 0.5.1 - 15th June 2014\n\n- Fix touch event handling.\n- Fix stacked=false in bar chart [#275](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/275)\n- Configurable vertical segments [#297](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/297)\n- Deprecate continuousLine option.\n\n### 0.5.0 - 19th March 2014\n\n- Update grunt dependency [#288](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/228)\n- Donut segment color config in data objects [#281](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/281)\n- Customisable line widths and point drawing [#272](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/272)\n- Bugfix for @options.smooth [#266](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/266)\n- Option to disable axes individually [#253](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/253)\n- Range selection [#252](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/252)\n- Week format for x-labels [#250](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/250)\n- Update developer quickstart instructions [#243](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/243)\n- Experimenting with perceptual diffs.\n- Add original data row to hover callback [#264](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/264)\n- setData method for donut charts [#211](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/211)\n- Automatic resizing [#111](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/111)\n- Fix travis builds [#298](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/298)\n- Option for rounded corners on bar charts [#305](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/305)\n- Option to set padding for X axis labels [#306](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/306)\n- Use local javascript for examples.\n- Events on non-time series [#314](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/314)\n\n### 0.4.3 - 12th May 2013\n\n- Fix flickering hover box [#186](https://github.com/morrisjs/morris.js/issues/186)\n- xLabelAngle option (diagonal labels!!)
